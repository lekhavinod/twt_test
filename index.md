# Who am I?

I am {{page.person}}. I live with my aunt, uncle, and cousin brother at Little Whingings, Surrey, in {{page.country}}. My character was created by teh renowed auther {{page.author}}.

## My occupation ##
I am a wizard living in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as muggles. I graduated from the renowned wizarding academy in Scotland named *Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry*.

### Something more about me ###
1. Strength
  - Courageous and compassionate
  - Endure hardships
  - Instinctive
  - Loyal

2. Weakness
  - Judgemental (and occasionally illogical)
  - Self absorbed
  - Emotional
  - Self sacrificing

### My family and friends ###

My immediate family are the Dursleys, but let's not go there. They hardly qualify to be called family. I was orphaned when my parents were murdered by dark wizard when I was a baby. And, I am the only surviving witness to that henious act.
